Using the Qt Framework, Coin3d, and accelerometer data to animate a human
body

To compile the Animator, you will need to install Coin3d and Qt.

For convenience, we recommend working in a Linux environment such as Ubuntu.
The following links lead to websites where you can install or emulate an Ubuntu OS.
http://www.ubuntu.com/ 
http://www.vmware.com/products/player/

To get started with Ubuntu, simply run the linux_setup script in the top level directory to install the necessary libraries.
This requires an internet connection.

For Windows or Mac, see the respective sites for each library to get installation files:
http://www.coin3d.org/
http://qt.nokia.com/products/

Please see the Animator_User_Guide.pdf for more information.

These sites also provide excellent documentation for Coin and Qt.

Also recommended for learning Coin: web books on Open Inventor (Coin uses the Open Inventor API):
